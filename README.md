# Football-Player-Value-Prediction
A data science project analyzing football player attributes and predicting market value using data visualization and machine learning models
# ⚽ Football Player Value Prediction  

This project analyzes football player data to understand **which factors influence player market value** and builds machine learning models to predict it.  
The project combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with predictive modeling to extract meaningful insights.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Football Player Value Prediction.ipynb` → Main Jupyter Notebook  
- `data/` → Dataset used for analysis (if included)  
- `images/` → Visualization outputs (charts & plots)  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze physical and technical attributes of football players  
- Explore relationships between features (age, height, stamina, sprint speed, dribbling, shooting, etc.)  
- Identify factors strongly influencing market value  
- Build machine learning models to predict player value  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following visualizations were created:
- Height vs Jumping  
- Weight vs Strength  
- Agility vs Dribbling  
- Stamina vs Sprint Speed  
- Top 10 Players by Dribbling  
- Top 10 Players by Shooting (Finishing + Shot Power)  
- Market Value by Age Group  
- Value vs Sprint Speed  
- Correlation Heatmap  
- Pair Plot  

**Key Insights:**  
- Taller players generally perform better in jumping.  
- Heavier players tend to have higher strength.  
- Agility and dribbling are strongly correlated.  
- Younger players (18–25) dominate high-value categories.  
- Overall rating and potential have the strongest impact on market value.

## 🤖 Machine Learning
- Models tested: **Linear Regression
- Evaluation Metrics: R² Score, Mean Absolute Error  

---

## 📌 Conclusion
- **Age, overall rating, and potential** are the strongest drivers of player value  
- **Physical traits** (stamina, sprint speed, strength) and **technical skills** (dribbling, shooting) directly affect market worth  
- Clubs tend to invest in **younger, faster, and highly skilled players**  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
